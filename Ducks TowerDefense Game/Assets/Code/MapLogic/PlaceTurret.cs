public class PlaceTurret : MonoBehaviour{

    //Singleton Pattern:
    //Creating a method to access building turret without referencing PlaceTurret in the Node.cs Script
    //Reason:   Easier to deal with, if I had reference it to the Node.cs Script
    //          This may cause a lot of errors or will be very annoying to deal with
    //          The reason it will be annoying to deal with is because every single gameobject(square) will have a implmenation of PlaceTurret
    //Public allow access without the class, and static because we want it be access only by PlaceTurret.cs 
    //This variable is a PlaceTurret inside a PlaceTurret. Basically stores a reference to itself

        instance = this;//everythime we start the game there is going to be one PlaceTurret 
                        //It going to call the awake method and store PlaceTurret in the instance variable
                        //This allows the instance variable to be access anywhere in PlaceTurret.cs Script
